# MemeAppiOS
Meme app iOS version 


User can ttake a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email or just save it into the phone. 

MemeApp covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

Please review the following animation to see how it works:

## Architecture

The app uses a classic MVM architecture, no ideal but it works well for this example, as a TODO I will create a PR using a MVVM pattern and removing all the logic placed in the controller. 

The idea is to grow the app according to the Udacity iOS ND Course
